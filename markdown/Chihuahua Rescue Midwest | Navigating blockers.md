As I began working on web based applications, one of the very first projects I completed for a client was designing and building a website for [Chihuahua Rescue Midwest](chihuahuarescue.zachhall.me). I will reference the charity as CRM from here on out.

CRM's original website was built using a drag and drop editor and lacked any form of responsive design. The application page didn't work, resulting in no potential adopter's.


Goal &rarr; increase adoption applications

One of the most valuable things I learned from this was how to effectively navigate potential 'blockers'. 

One of the higher up's of CRM was against a website rebuild, after digging we discovered that she didn't wanted a rebuild as they felt they would lost control.

By including them in the design process, and implementeing the feature described below, we were able to gain their support.

Using netlify CMS, we were able to create an admin page for approved users to add available dogs which would be displayed on [this](https://chihuahuarescue.zachhall.me/dogs/) page.

End Results:

* 200% increase in dog applications
* 96% decrease in yearly hosting fees

Often, there is some underlying reason preventing someone from giving their support to your project. If you can accurately identify what it is, you might be able to come to an agreement that makes both parties happy.
